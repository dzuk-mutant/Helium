## Dimensions

A few quick mixins to make sizing stuff quicker. These are generally companion functions to the icon functions.


#### size()
For sizing stuff. 


`size(value)` for square sizing.

`size(vertical, horizontal)` for rectangular sizing.



#### size-reduce()
This is to apply negative margins to the object. This is most commonly used in making icon geometry conform to keylines.


`size-reduce(value)` for square margins.

`size-reduce(vertical, horizontal)` for different margins for each axis.
