## Icons

Thorium has a variety of helpful shortcuts to quickly create icon styles. Some bases have already been created for you.

Thorium revolves around using font icons because they are easy to recolour and size.

**The default class for all icons begins with `ic-`. Feel free to change this if it doesn't work with your own internal nomenclature/workflow.**

#### size()
For sizing icons. 


`size(value)` for square sizing.

`size(vertical, horizontal)` for rectangular sizing.

#### size-reduce()
This is to apply negative margins to the icon to make icons conform to keylines.


`size(value)` for square margins.

`size(vertical, horizontal)` for different margins for each axis.
