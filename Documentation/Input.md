#Input

Input base styling is simply to set up actual styles. Inputs are generally unusable without additional classes. Check out the `base` class to see examples of button styling.


##Button

Buttons are structured like so:

	<button>
		<div>
			<!-- content -->
		</div>
	</button>

The extra div is to enable completely flexible positioning.
